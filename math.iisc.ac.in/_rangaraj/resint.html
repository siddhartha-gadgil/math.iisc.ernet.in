        <p align="justify"> <b><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</b></p>
        <p align="justify">I work in the general areas of nonlinear dynamics,
          time series analysis and applied stochastic dynamics. I apply my work
          in areas like neuroscience, geophysics and accelerator physics. A more
          detailed description of my research work is given below. </p>
          
        <p align="justify"> <b><a name="Granger"></a>Granger Causality from Fourier and Wavelet Transforms</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Extracting information flow in networks of coupled
         dynamical systems from the time series measurements of their
         activity is of great interest in physical, biological and social
         sciences. Such knowledge holds the key to the understanding of
         phenomena ranging from turbulent fluids to interacting genes and
         proteins to networks of neural ensembles. Granger causality
         has emerged in recent years as a leading
         statistical technique for accomplishing this goal. The definition of
         Granger causality is based on the theory of
         linear prediction and its original estimation
         framework requires autoregressive (AR) modeling of time series data. 
         This is a parametric approach to estimating Granger causality. </p>
        <p align="justify"> The above parametric approach has certain weaknesses. We
        overcame this by proposing a nonparametric approach to
        estimate Granger causality (in the spectral domain) directly from Fourier and wavelet
        transforms of data, eliminating the need of explicit AR modeling.
        This approach makes use of spectral factorization. 
        Time-domain Granger causality can be obtained by integrating the
        corresponding spectral representation over frequency. This method
        was successfully applied to both simulated data and data from a neuroscience 
        experiment. </p>
        <p align="justify"><b><a name="Granger2"></a>Granger Causality for Point Processes</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Simultaneous recordings of spike trains from
        multiple single neurons are becoming commonplace. Mathematically, 
        spike trains can be modeled as point processes. 
        Understanding the interaction patterns among these spike
        trains (point processes) remains a key research area. A question of interest is
        the evaluation of information flow between neurons
        through the analysis of whether one spike train exerts
        causal influence on another. For continuous-valued time
        series data, Granger causality has proven an effective
        method for this purpose. However, the basis for Granger
        causality estimation is autoregressive data modeling, which
        is not directly applicable to spike trains. Various filtering
        options distort the properties of spike trains as point
        processes. We proposed a new nonparametric approach
        to estimate Granger causality directly from the Fourier
        transforms of spike train data. We validated the method on
        synthetic spike trains generated by model networks of
        neurons with known connectivity patterns and then applied it
        to neurons simultaneously recorded from the thalamus and
        the primary somatosensory cortex of a squirrel monkey
        undergoing tactile stimulation.</p>         
         <p align="justify"><b><a name="Granger3"></a>Mitigating the Effects of Noise on Granger Causality</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Computing Granger causal relations among bivariate experimentally
        observed time series has received increasing attention over the past
        few years. Such causal relations, if correctly estimated, can yield
        significant insights into the dynamical organization of the system
        being investigated. Since experimental measurements are inevitably
        contaminated by noise, it is thus important to understand the
        effects of such noise on Granger causality estimation. Using the theory of
        stochastic processes, we showed mathematically that two effects can arise:
        (1) spurious causality between two measured variables
        can arise and (2) true causality can be suppressed. We also demonstrated these 
        effects numerically. We then provided a denoising strategy to mitigate this
        problem. Specifically, we proposed a denoising algorithm based on the
        combined use of the Kalman filter theory and the
        Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Numerical examples were used
        to demonstrate the effectiveness of the denoising approach.<p>
        <p align="justify">We applied the above method to denoise two 
        datasets of local field potentials recorded from monkeys performing a 
        visuomotor task. For the first dataset, it was found that the analysis 
        of the high gamma band (60-90 Hz) neural activity in the prefrontal cortex 
        is highly susceptible to the effect of noise, and denoising leads to 
        markedly improved results that were physiologically interpretable. 
        For the second dataset, Granger causality between primary motor and 
        primary somatosensory cortices was not consistent across two monkeys 
        and the effect of noise was suspected. After denoising, the discrepancy 
        between the two subjects was significantly reduced.</p>     
        <p align="justify"><b><a name="Extinction"></a>Synchronized Extinction
        of Species</b></p>
        <p align="justify">More than 99% of the species that ever existed on the
        surface of the earth are now extinct and their extinction on a global
        scale has been a puzzle. One may think that a species under an external
        threat may survive in some isolated locations leading to the revival of
        the species. Using a general model we show that, under a common external
        forcing, the species with a quadratic saturation term first undergoes
        spatial synchronization and then extinction. The effect can be observed
        even when the external forcing acts only on some locations provided the
        dynamics contains a synchronizing term. Absence of the quadratic
        saturation term can help the species to avoid extinction.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><a name="Movement"></a>Movement Prediction in Neuroscience</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Among the awesome repertoire of tasks that the human
          brain can accomplish, one of the more fascinating ones is how the electrical
          activity of millions of brain cells (neurons) is translated into precise
          sequences of movements. </p>
        <p align="justify">One of the greatest challenges in applied neuroscience
          is to build prosthetic limbs controlled by neural signals from the brain.
          The ultimate goal is to provide paralytic patients and amputees with
          the means to move and communicate by controlling the prosthetic device
          using brain activity. Scientists and engineers are slowly getting closer
          to building such devices thanks to studies revealing a strong connection
          between the activity of neurons in the brain's cerebral cortex and the
          movements of limbs.</p>
        <p align="justify">With the above goal in mind, we have performed some
          preliminary analysis of experimental data from a macaque monkey. We considered an experiment where the monkey moves
          its hand in one of the eight directions based on visual cues. The goal
          was to predict the direction of movement correctly before the hand movement
          actually starts. Signals were recorded from an array of microelectrodes
          implanted in the monkey's motor cortex. As a first step, we computed
          the summed power in the gamma frequency band for each channel and trial. Using the Mahalanobis distance, we then predicted the
          direction of movement from a single trial multichannel data. We
          obtained successful predictions significantly above the random chance
          level.</p>
          <p align="justify"> Presently we are conducting a major brain-machine interface
          experiment and results are expected soon.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><a name="LinearCaus"></a>Comparison of Linear Causality Measures</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Given the deluge of multi-channel data generated by
          experiments in neuroscience, the role of multivariate time series processing,
          especially the nonlinear time series processing, has become crucial.
          In particular, obtaining causal relations among signals is important
          in identifying functional relations between different regions of the
          brain. Over the years Gersch causality (which uses partial
          coherence analysis) has been employed explicitly or implicitly by many
          researchers as a way of identifying connectivity, sources of driving
          or causal influence. </p>
        <p align="justify">For real world neurobiological data, a complicating
          factor is that the time series picked up by a sensor is inevitably the
          mixture of the signal of interest (e.g. theta oscillation in the hippocampus)
          and other unrelated processes, collectively referred to as the measurement
          noise. We studied the effectiveness of the two different causality measures,
          the Gersch causality and the Granger causality, in the above noisy situation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">We studied experimental recordings from the limbic
          system of the rat during theta oscillations and showed that the application
          of partial coherence and Gersch causality can lead to contradictory
          conclusions. We hypothesized that the observed phenomena can be explained
          by the differential levels of signal to noise ratio. We performed extensive
          simulations involving multiple time series to confirm this. The main
          point of our work was that, despite its wide use, partial coherence
          based Gersch causality is extremely sensitive to measurement noise and
          often could lead to erroneous results. We then applied Granger causality
          to the data and simulation results and showed that it is robust against
          moderate levels of noise. </p>
        <p align="justify"><b><a name="NonlinCaus"></a>Nonlinear Causality Measures</b></p>
        <p align="justify">We addressed the problem of obtaining nonlinear causality
          measures. We extended the Granger causality theory to nonlinear time
          series by incorporating the embedding reconstruction technique for multivariate
          time series. A three-step algorithm was presented and used to analyze
          various nonlinear time series. We demonstrated that our method always
          gives reliable results. </p>
        <p align="justify">When three time series have to be analyzed, the conditional
          nonlinear causality index proposed by us can distinguish between direct
          and indirect causal relationships between any two of the time series.
          This is not possible using simple pairwise analysis. </p>
        <p align="justify"><b><a name="NeuralNet"></a>Neural Networks</b></p>
        <p align="justify">For oscillatory neural networks, the stability of the
          equilibrium point is an important property for many neural computational
          applications. Aided by results from nonnegative matrices we demonstrated,
          using two simple models of coupled neural populations of arbitrary size,
          a general methodology that can yield explicit bounds on the individual
          coupling strengths to ensure the stability of the equilibrium point.</p>
        <b><a name="FirstPassage"></a>First Passage Time Problems</b><font color="#990099">
        </font>
        <p align="justify"> First passage time problem for stochastic processes
          is a well known problem with applications in physics, chemistry, biology
          and engineering. The exact first passage time distribution is known
          only for a few specific stochastic processes (the most notable being
          the Brownian motion). Finding the exact first passage time distribution
          for a broader class of stochastic processes is therefore an important
          problem. We obtained the exact first passage density function for Levy
          type stochastic processes with zero and nonzero drifts. This work involved
          application of results from probability theory, fractional calculus
          and Fox or H-functions. Further, asymptotic results for another class
          of stochastic processes (fractional Brownian motion and its generalizations)
          were also obtained. </p>
        <b><a name="Synchro"></a>Synchronization and Pattern Formation in Coupled
        Dynamical Systems </b>
        <p align="justify"> Coupled dynamical systems are used to model spatially
          extended nonlinear systems (such as the brain) by utilizing well understood
          dynamical systems as building blocks. In coupled dynamical systems,
          the individual constituent systems (called nodes) are coupled to one
          another using specified coupling strengths. A very interesting form
          of behaviour which occurs in coupled dynamical systems is the synchronization
          of the nodes. </p>
        <p align="justify">This has found applications in a variety of fields
          including communications, optics, neuroscience, neural networks and
          geophysics. An essential prerequisite for these applications is to know
          the bounds on the coupling strengths so that the stability of the synchronous
          state is ensured. Previous attempts aimed at obtaining such conditions
          have typically looked either at systems of very small size or at very
          specific coupling schemes (diffusive coupling, global all to all coupling
          etc. with a single coupling strength). </p>
        <p align="justify">We obtained stability bounds for the synchronized state
          in coupled systems with arbitrary coupling. These bounds extend previously
          available results. Based on the Gershgorin disc theory and the stability
          region/master stability function, we developed general approaches that
          yield constraints directly on the coupling strengths which ensure the
          stability of synchronized dynamics.</p>
        <p align="justify">In a reaction-diffusion system, at the Turing bifurcation
          point, the global equilibrium state becomes unstable and an inhomogeneous
          spatial pattern known as a Turing pattern emerges. Following Turing's
          classic work, pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems has become
          a major topic of investigation both theoretically and experimentally
          with applications in diverse fields of science and engineering. </p>
        <p align="justify">We derived explicit analytical expressions defining
          the stability region in the parameter space spanned by the coupling
          strengths. We demonstrated that, by following different paths
          in the parameter space, different spatiotemporal patterns can be selectively
          realized. Conversely, given a desired spatiotemporal pattern, we were
          able to design coupling schemes which give rise to that pattern as the
          coupled system evolves. Although the spatial patterns are the same for a given
          coupling matrix, we showed that, depending on whether the original synchronized
          state is a fixed point or a chaotic attractor, the temporal evolution
          of the patterns is either constant in time or modulated in an on-off
          intermittent fashion. </p>
        <b><a name="ProcessesLong"></a>Processes with Long Range Correlations</b><font color="#990099">
        </font>
        <p align="justify"> To assess whether a given time series can be modeled
          by a stochastic process possessing long memory one usually applies one
          of two types of analysis methods: the spectral method and the random
          walk analysis. We showed that each one of these methods used alone can
          be susceptible to producing false results. We thus advocated an integrated
          approach which requires the use of both methods in a consistent fashion.
          We provided the theoretical foundation of this approach and illustrated
          the main ideas using examples. We also analysed the observation of long
          range anticorrelation (Hurst exponent $H<1/2$) in real world time series
          data. The very peculiar nature of such processes was emphasized in light
          of the stringent condition under which such processes can occur. Using
          examples we discussed the possible factors that could contribute to
          the false claim of long range anticorrelations and demonstrated the
          particular importance of the integrated approach in this case. </p>
        <b><a name="ANewMethod"></a>A New Method for Computing Lyapunov Exponents</b><font color="#990099">
        </font>
        <p align="justify"> Chaotic dynamics is an important field of research
          with applications in many areas of science and engineering. Specific
          examples of such areas include astrophysical, biological and chemical
          systems, mechanical devices, models of the weather, lasers, plasmas
          and fluids, to mention a few. It is important to be able to identify
          chaotic systems since one can predict the future behaviour of such systems
          only for a limited period of time. This is due to the fact that these
          systems exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions, i.e. two
          trajectories which start out close to each other diverge exponentially.
          The Lyapunov exponents precisely quantify this exponential divergence
          and a positive Lyapunov exponent implies the presence of chaotic behaviour
          in the system. Moreover, practical algorithms to compute Lyapunov exponents
          can be devised. For these reasons, Lyapunov exponents have become the
          primary tool to detect chaos in a given system. Any good method for
          computing Lyapunov exponents has, therefore, wide applicability in several
          areas of science and engineering. </p>
        <p align="justify"> We obtained a new, accurate method for the computation
          of Lyapunov exponents for arbitrary continuous-time dynamical systems.
          Our method makes full use of the group-theoretical representations of
          orthogonal matrices applied to decompositions of M where M is the tangent
          map of the system. Our method analytically obviates the need for rescaling
          and reorthogonalization. Our method also does away with the other shortcomings
          listed above: A partial Lyapunov spectrum can be computed using a fewer
          number of equations as compared to the computation of the full spectrum,
          there is no difficulty in evaluating degenerate Lyapunov spectra, the
          equations are straightforward to generalize to higher dimensions, and
          the method uses the minimal set of dynamical variables. Since our method
          is based on exact differential equations for the Lyapunov exponents,
          global invariances of the Lyapunov spectrum can be preserved. Preservation
          of such invariants is important in stationary, thermostatted nonequilibrium
          systems. The above method has now been extended to computation of Lyapunov
          exponents for arbitrary discrete maps. This method also has all the
          nice properties mentioned above. </p>

        <p align="justify"> Hamiltonian systems form an important class of dynamical
          systems and can be used to describe many physical systems. An important
          question concerning any such system is its long-term nonlinear stability.
          Specifically, we are interested in the long-term stability of particles
          being transported through this system. Generically these systems are
          non-integrable and it is therefore very difficult to give stability
          criteria in an analytic form. A possible solution is to numerically
          follow the trajectories of particles through the system for a large
          number of periods (a process that goes by the name of tracking). One
          could then attempt to infer the stability of motion in the system by
          analyzing these tracking results. </p>
        <p align="justify"> The most straightforward method that can be used to
          perform this long-term tracking is numerical integration. However, this
          method is too slow for analyzing the stability of very complicated systems.
          Further, any method that we use should preserve the symplectic structure
          that is inherent in any Hamiltonian system. Conventional numerical integration
          methods, like the Runge-Kutta method, do not preserve this structure.
          This can lead to either spurious chaotic behaviour or damping. Consequently,
          there is a possibility of getting wrong stability results when using
          such non-symplectic integrators. Therefore, we need a symplectic integrator
          that is both fast and accurate. </p>
        <p align="justify"> Several symplectic integration methods have been discussed
          in the literature using generating functions. These are typically implicit
          methods and employing these methods requires one to use Newton's method
          with its attendent questions of convergence etc. We have obtained a
          new method for symplectic integration of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems.
          In this method, the Hamiltonian system is first represented as a symplectic
          map. This map (in general) has an infinite Taylor series expansion.
          In practice, one can compute only a finite number of terms in this series.
          This gives rise to a truncated map approximation of the original map.
          This truncated map is, however, not symplectic and can lead to wrong
          stability results when iterated (as noted earlier). To overcome this
          problem, the map is refactorized as a product of special maps called
          "jolt maps" in such a manner that symplecticity is maintained. These
          jolt maps are nilpotent operators of rank 2 and hence have only two
          nonzero terms in their Taylor series expansion when acting on phase
          space variables. The method makes use of properties of the Lie group
          SU(3) and its associated discrete subgroups. Moreover, a scheme to optimize
          the number of jolt maps required in this method have been outlined.
          This involves splitting the integration over SU(3) into an integration
          over the group SO(3) followed by an integration over the coset space
          SU(3)/SO(3). </p>
        <p align="justify"> We have applied the above symplectic integration method
          using jolt factorization to the symplectic map describing the nonlinear
          pendulum Hamiltonian. This example was chosen since the pendulum is
          the prototypical nonlinear Hamiltonian system which has the further
          advantage that analytical solutions are available facilitating easy
          comparisons. The symplectic map corresponding to the pendulum Hamiltonian
          was obtained and truncated at the eighth order. This map was then refactorized
          using jolt maps. Using this for integration, results which agreed well
          with the exact results were obtained. In contrast, a non-symplectic
          eighth order integration method was shown to give rise to spurious chaotic
          behaviour. This demonstrated the advantages of using the symplectic
          integration method outlined above. </p>
        <p align="justify"> Using solvable and polynomial symplectic maps, symplectic
          integration algorithms which can be easily generalized to higher dimensions
          were also obtained.

          Sp(6,R) and SU(3)</b><font color="#990099"><b> </b></font>
        <p align="justify"> In the study of nonlinear Hamiltonian dynamics, the
          real symplectic group Sp(2n,R) and its compact subgroups play an important
          role. Quite often, one studies the single particle dynamics of nonlinear
          Hamiltonian systems. Since this has three degrees of freedom, the relevant
          group is Sp(6,R). Moreover, the equations of motion are formulated in
          terms of phase space variables (generalized coordinates and momenta).
          In particular, in Lie perturbation theory of Hamiltonian dynamics, homogeneous
          polynomials of phase space variables play a central role. Therefore,
          it is important to study the representations of Sp(6,R) carried by these
          polynomials. Further, in deriving symplectic integration algorithms
          for Hamiltonian systems (which was discussed in the previous section),
          representations of compact subgroups of Sp(6,R) (especially SU(3)) carried
          by homogeneous polynomials are required. They may also be useful in
          deriving metric invariants for symplectic maps. </p>
        <p align="justify"> For the above reasons, we studied representations
          of Sp(6,R) and SU(3) carried by homogeneous polynomials of phase space
          variables. It was proved that homogeneous polynomials of degree m carry
          the irreducible representation (m,0,0) of both the Lie algebra sp(6,R)
          and the corresponding Lie group Sp(6,R). Relations between representations
          of sp(6,R) and Sp(6,R) were established. Under the action of SU(3),
          the representations obtained above are reducible and can be written
          as a direct sum of irreducible representations of SU(3). Finally, explicit
          expressions for SU(3) states within these representations were given
          in terms of phase space variables. Such expressions are useful in symplectic
          integration theory. </p>
        <p align="justify"> We also obtained a rather unconventional real basis
          for the symplectic algebra sp(2n,R). We demonstrated the utility of
          this basis for practical computations by giving a simple derivation
          of the second and fourth order indices of irreducible representations
          of sp(2n,R).

        <p align="justify"> Understanding climatic dynamics and variability is
          an important problem in geophysics. One can attempt to solve this problem
          by developing elaborate climate models and studying them numerically.
          This requires tremendous amount of computer time and effort. Therefore,
          it would be good to have some simple measures of climatic variablity
          which can be used to understand the underlying dynamics in a gross sense
          and to exhibit linkages between different climatic dynamics. </p>
        <p align="justify"> We proposed a novel climate predictability index.
          It quantifies, in a simple manner, the predictability of three major
          components comprising the climate - temperature, pressure and precipitation.
          The quantification was done using a fractal dimensional analysis of
          the corresponding time series as described below. It is well known that
          a geophysical time series can be modelled as a fractional Brownian motion.
          Using this fact, it is possible to apply rescaled range (R/S) analysis
          to the time series and calculate its so-called Hurst exponent. This
          Hurst exponent is related in a simple manner to the fractal dimension
          of the time series curve. Fractal dimensions close to 1.5 and 1.0 correspond
          to low and high predictability respectively. This correspondence was
          exploited to define a predictability index. The climate predictability
          index was calculated for stations in India using the Global Historical
          Climatology Network dataset. Change in the index with the seasons suggested
          a strong influence of more than one climatic dynamics. In such cases,
          calculations done using mean yearly data were shown to be suspect. The
          index was shown to be useful in studying the interplay between various
          climatic components (viz. temperature, pressure and precipitation).
          Changes in predictability indices for temperature and pressure were
          seen to affect the index for precipitation. The index can be used as
          a discriminant for determining which stations are selected for use in
          developing regional climatic models. </p>

        </font>
        <p align="justify"> One of the striking phenomena exhibited by a wide
          variety of complex adaptive systems is that individual agents or components
          of the system evolve to perform highly specialized tasks, and at the
          same time the system as a whole evolves towards a greater diversity
          in terms of the kinds of individual agents or components it contains
          or the tasks that are performed in it. Some examples of this include
          living systems which have evolved increasingly specialized and diverse
          kinds of interacting protein molecules, ecologies which develop diverse
          species with specialized traits, early human societies which evolve
          from a state where everyone shares in a small number of chores to a
          state with many more activities performed largely by specialists, and
          firms in an economic web that explore and occupy increasingly specialized
          and diverse niches. Since the above phenomenon is so widespread, it
          would be useful to have a mathematical model which captures this. </p>
        <p align="justify"> We have proposed a mathematical model of economic
          communities that exhibits these twin evolutionary phenomena of specialization
          and diversity. The community consists of N interacting agents. Each
          agent's activity consists of an individual mix out of a fixed set of
          strategies. Agents receive a payoff depending on activities of the entire
          community, and independently modify their own mix of strategies to increase
          their payoff. The dynamics obtained is a generalized replicator dynamics
          and consists of a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations
          describing the time evolution of the activities of individual agents.
          We proved certain theorems and obtained numerical results for the attractors
          of the system. We focused our attention on attractors that have the
          property of individual specialization and global diversity. Under certain
          conditions, the desired attractors were shown to exist and have basins
          of attraction that cover the entire configuration space. Thus the evolutionary
          phenomena mentioned above occur generically in the model. We have described
          properties a new strategy should have (in the context of already existing
          activities) in order for it to be "accepted" by the community. Thus
          the model suggests a natural mechanism for the emergence of context
          dependent innovations in the community. It was also shown that under
          certain generic conditions on the payoff matrix parameters, the agents
          exhibit a collective behaviour, and for sufficiently large N, the community
          exhibits diversity and self-organization. </p>
        <b><a name="EvolutionaryGames"></a>Evolutionary Games with Two Time Scales</b><font color="#990099">
        </font>
        <p align="justify"> One of the classical problems in game theory and economics
          is that of equilibrium selection. In a typical situation, one has many
          candidate equilibria and the problem of selecting the right one has
          to be solved. One approach towards this problem is to construct dynamic
          models of disequilibrium wherein the desired equilibrium arises as an
          attractor of the proposed dynamics. The dynamics are intended to model
          economic agents in an interactive environment where they `learn' from
          experience and adapt their strategy in real times. Exisitng models fall
          into two distinct classes representing two different modes of learning.
          In the first class of models, one retains the identity of individual
          agents in a finite collection and postulates adaptation rules for individual
          learning which lead to the aggregate behaviour being studied. In the
          second class of models, the population itself adapts by incrementally
          reinforcing or discouraging (implicitly, through birth-death mechanisms)
          the strategies that give respectively higher and lower payoffs than
          the current average. There are, however, no models which combine both
          these features even though this is perfectly acceptable in economic
          situations. </p>
        <p align="justify"> We proposed a new two tier model of learning. In this
          model, active or `ontogenetic' learning by individuals takes place on
          a fast time scale and passive or `phylogenetic' learning by society
          as a whole on a slow time scale, each affecting the evolution of the
          other. The former is modelled by the Monte Carlo dynamics of statistical
          physics where the individual updates his strategy to pick moves that
          yield higher payoffs with higher probability, retaining at the same
          time `expensive' moves, albeit with a low probability. The latter may
          be attributed to random exploration or errors. We superimpose on this,
          on a slower time scale, the replicator dynamics, describing the evolution
          of a conglomeration of economic agents under selection pressure from
          the environment (which may include other such conglomerations). The
          two dynamics interact through the payoff matrices that enter their velocity
          fields. This leads to a two time scale evolution, which can then be
          cast in the framework of singularly perturbed ordinary differential
          equations. The Monte Carlo dynamics for ontogenetic learning was analyzed
          in some detail, particularly for the n=2 symmetric case. We carried
          out numerical simulations which showed a rich variety of qualitative
          behaviour. In some cases, the two dynamics counter act each other so
          as to have the system poised in between two distinct kinds of equilibria,
          reminiscent of (but distinct from) self-organized criticality. In other
          cases, under similar situations, one obtains sustained oscillations
          between two equilibria, a phenomenon reminiscent of (but distinct from)
          noise-induced transitions on one hand and heteroclinic cycles on the
          other. </p>

          the Guliya ice core. These records have important implications for the
          evolution of the Southwest Monsoon System. We observed three distinct
          climatic events (viz. 19 ka to 13.5 ka, 13.5 ka to 10 ka and 3.4 ka
          to present) from the last glacial phase to the present. Even though
          the first two events are well documented in the literature, our combined
          analysis of data from both the cores suggested alternative mechanisms
          which could have complemented and strengthened these events. The third,
          most recent event (occurring between 3.4 ka to present) does not seem
          to have been well documented earlier. We proposed a possible mechanism
          to explain this event. We identified representative elements which better
          capture the above events as compared to more commonly used elements.

          to the Arctic. Our analysis of the data suggested that it took about
          7.6 ka for onset of climate change to propagate globally. We proposed
          that the tropical Pacific played a major role in initiating the warming
          in the tropics. We discussed mechanisms that could have transported

          generating high accelerating gradients in next generation accelerators.
          Theoretical behaviour of this laser was studied. Stability of the system
          when perturbed was investigated both analytically and numerically. These
          studies established that the proposed free-electron laser was stable

        <p align="justify"> We proposed a novel type of FEL as a practical device
          to generate brief, intense pulses of radiation. This FEL (which we called
          the multi-cavity FEL) has many optical cavities where the cavities communicate
          with each other, not optically, but through the electron beam. The idea
          is to simply make the FEL optical cavities sufficiently short that the
          slippage length, in any one optical cavity, is less than the electron
          pulse width. When electrons reach the end of one cavity they go into
          the next, but the radiation remains trapped within that cavity. We also
          studied a mathematical model of this FEL both analytically and numerically.
          In the one-dimensional approximation, a general expression for the growth
          rate in the exponential (high current) regime was obtained. In the regime
          where lethargy is important, expressions were given in the two opposite
          limits of small and large number of cavities and bunches. Extensive
          numerical investigations of the nonlinear effects were performed. The
          multi-cavity FEL was shown to be useful to avoid slippage phenomena,
          and thus to make pico-second pulses of infra-red radiation. Some examples

          will be required to travel over a length of 10m or more in pipes with
          small diameters. Transverse resistive wall effects could lead to beam
          breakup during this transport. To investigate this possibility, we solved
          the equation of motion for a bunched beam analytically. We showed that
          a steady state solution is reached for times larger than the diffusion
          time. This solution can either oscillate or grow exponentially with
          the length of the pipe, depending on the relative magnitudes of the
          resistive wall effect and the focusing force in the wiggler. The possibility
          of a significant transient was also studied in great detail. </p>
