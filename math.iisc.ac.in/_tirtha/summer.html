						<p><b>Policy about summer students</b></p>
						<p> Every year, I get a lot of requests from students who want to do a
project in summer. In the kind of mathematics that I do, a
project at an undergraduate level or at a irst year post-graduate level, means reading, understanding and solving problems on a known piece of mathematics.
This involves, to begin with, a careful selection of a piece of
existing good mathematics that is accessible in the sense that it is
not too hard to grasp for a student. At the same time,
the topic has to be interesting. This leads to a difficult task of 
choosing a topic that is not trivial and not too advanced. Needless to
say, the aptitude and the training of the fellow has to be taken into
account.</p>

<p> Usually, a summer fellow spends about eight weeks here. My aim is to
have regular interactions, about thrice a week, so that towards the
end of the duration, the fellow has a fairly good idea or a good
glimpse of a new sub-area of mathematics. Given the time that will be
required to do a serious job, I usually accept no more than two summer
fellows.</p>

<p> 
Apart from the academic part, there are other issues associated with a
summer fellow. Accommodation is one of them. Finding an accommodation
for a long duration in summer is practically impossible. In addition, it will be appreciated if the summer fellows spare me the logistics and paperwork. 
It is the fellow's responsibility to figure out the rules and regulations pertaining to the funding agency, 
the institute and the department and pursure appropriate paperwork if necessary.</p>

<p> In view of all these, I request all prospective summer fellows not to
write to me. Instead, it is advisable to apply to established summer
programs. I mention here two of them. The first one is the Summer
Research Fellowship Program of the academies,
<a href="http://web-japps.ias.ac.in:8080/fellowship2013/">http://web-japps.ias.ac.in:8080/fellowship2013/</a> The second one is the
summer fellowship program of JNCASR.
