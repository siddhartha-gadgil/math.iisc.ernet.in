 <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this topics course, we would like to try out the  notion of approaching the essential concepts in several  complex variables with the eventual aim of studying  some topics in multi-variable complex dynamics.</font></p>

 <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the course will begin with a complete and  rigorous introduction to holomorphic functions in several variables and their properties.  This will pave the way to motivating and studying the concept  of plurisubharmonicity.</font></p>

 <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, we shall study some complex dynamics ‒ i.e., the dynamics of the iterations  of  a holomorphic map in several variables ‒ using the tools developed.</font></p>
 
 <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Prerequisites :  </b>MA 224 (i.e., the first course in Complex Analysis) and, preferably, MA 324 (Topics in Complex Analysis in One Variable). Students who have not taken MA 324 but are highly interested in this course are encouraged to speak to the instructor.</font></p>
