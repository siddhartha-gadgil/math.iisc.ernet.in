The Department aims to promote close collaboration between various mathematical disciplines and with other applied areas. The areas of current research are :

#### Algebraic and Combinatorial Topology
Combinatorial manifolds, PL-manifolds, minimal triangulation of manifolds, triangulation of spheres and projective planes with few vertices, pseudomanifolds With small excess, equivelar polyhectral maps.

#### Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry
Study of derivation modules of curves and hypersurfaces, connection with Zariski - Lipman conjecture, monomial curves, complete intersections and set theoretic complete intersections, intersection theory of algebraic varieties, minimal number of generators for ideals and modules. Study of certain algebraic surfaces.

#### Differential Equations
Homogenization of partial differential equations, controllability, viscosity solutions.

#### Differential Geometry
Manifolds of positive curvature (Ricci, scalar and isotropic), Einstein manifolds, conformal geometry (Weyl curvature and the Yamabe invariant), Gromov hyperbolic spaces.

#### Functional Analysis and Operator Theory
Hilbert modules, multivariable operator theory, indefinite inner product spaces.

#### Harmonic Analysis
Analysis on the Heisenberg group and generalisations such as H-type groups, analysis on symmetric spaces of non compact type and on semisimple Lie groups, spectral multipliers of Laplcians and sub-Laplacians on these spaces, integral geometry on homogeneous spaces and relations with complex analysis.

Theoretical (i.e., study of approximate equations), numerical (i.e., computation of solutions with discontinuties) and applied (sonic boom, extension of Fermat's principle) problems.

#### Nonlinear Dynamics
