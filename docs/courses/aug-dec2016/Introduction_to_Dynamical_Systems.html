The course introduces basic mathematical techniques to understand qualitatively the 
long-term behaviour of systems evolving in time. Most of the phenomena occurring 
in nature, and around us, are nonlinear in nature and often these exhibit interesting 
behaviour which could be unpredictable and counterintuitive. Tools and  techniques 
of dynamical systems theory help in understanding the behaviour of systems and in 
gaining control over their behaviour, to a certain extent. Dynamical systems theory
has wide applications in the study of complex systems, including physical & 
biological systems, engineering, aerodynamics, economics, etc.
