              <p>Department of Mathematics was established in 1956 and over the 
                years has evolved into a Department with a healthy balance between 
                pure and applied mathematics. The Department has a vibrant research 
                atmosphere backed up by excellent infrastructural facilities. 
                We have a modern computer laboratory and a good Departmental library. 
                <a href="people-fac.html">Members of our faculty</a> have won many 
                honours in recognition of their academic achievements. </p>
              <p>The Department admits students under two programmes - the <a href="degprog-phd.html">Ph.D. 
                programme</a> and the <a href="degprog-intphd.html">integrated 
                Ph.D. programme</a>. Further information can be found by following 
                the links on the home page. In the current economic scenario, 
                employment opportunities for Ph.D.'s in mathematics are excellent 
                - both in academics and in industry. </p>
              <p>The Department has pioneered interdisciplinary programmes like 
                the <a href="http://math.iisc.ernet.in/~imi" target="_blank">IISc 
                Mathematics Initiative</a>. It takes active part in the Indo-French <a href="http://disc.iisc.ernet.in/ficus/ficus.html" target="_blank">Cyber 
                University project</a> with Toulouse University Network. The Department 
                is also deeply involved in the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana 
                and the <a href="http://vyasa.math.iisc.ernet.in/" target="_blank">Mathematical 
                Olympiad</a> programme.</p>
